## Work

### Summer Internship<br/> [Teledyne SP Devices](https://www.spdevices.com), 2023

* Development of new ADQ Digitizer IP in SystemVerilog.
* Refactoring and development of software in C/C++ to support the IP.
* Testing and validation with the help of VUnit and digitzer hardware. 

### Summer Internship<br/> Nira Dynamics, 2022

Research project about future solutions to store and query data from connected cars. 

### Teaching Assistant<br/> Linköping University, 2020–2022

Teaching and lab supervision in circuit theory courses for engineering students.

### Summer Internship<br/> Cendio, 2021

Made contributions to [TigerVNC](https://github.com/TigerVNC/tigervnc) for improving support and management of multiple monitors.

### Software Developer <br/>Plejd, 2018–2019<br/>Full-time

* Took part in designing, developing and testing a [Buildroot](https://buildroot.org)-based embedded Linux system for a consumer product.
* Developed a [NATS](https://nats.io)-based microservice architecture with our own server and client stack.
* Developed software for communication with co-processors, cloud services, OTA update servers, bluetooth-mesh services, manufacturing test-fixtures and third-party services. 
* We focused on building a future-proof, maintainable and reliable system with great extensibility. The design allowed us to continously expand the system with new functionality. 

### Software Developer <br/>Inceptive, 2017-2018<br/>Part-time

* Developed a concept application for traffic visualization in augmented reality.
* The app was built using Unity and I was primarly responsible for data streaming and integration with ARKit for Apple platforms.
