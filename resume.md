## Work

### Summer Internship<br/> Teledyne SP Devices, 2023

### Summer Internship<br/> Nira Dynamics, 2022

Research project about future solutions to store and query data from connected cars. 

### Teaching Assistant<br/> Linköping University, 2020–2022

Teaching and lab supervision in circuit theory courses for engineering students.

### Summer Internship<br/> Cendio, 2021

Made contributions to [TigerVNC](https://github.com/TigerVNC/tigervnc) for improving support and management of multiple monitors.

### Software Developer <br/>Plejd, 2018–2019<br/>Full-time

* Took part in designing, developing and testing a [Buildroot](https://buildroot.org)-based embedded Linux system for a consumer product.
* Developed a [NATS](https://nats.io)-based microservice architecture with our own server and client stack.
* Developed software for communication with co-processors, cloud services, OTA update servers, bluetooth-mesh services, manufacturing test-fixtures and third-party services. 
* We focused on building a future-proof, maintainable and reliable system with great extensibility. The design allowed us to continously expand the system with new functionality. 

### Software Developer <br/>Inceptive, 2017-2018<br/>Part-time

* Developed a concept application for traffic visualization in augmented reality.
* The app was built using Unity and I was primarly responsible for data streaming and integration with ARKit for Apple platforms.

## Skills

### Languages

Swedish and English.

### Software Development

I have been programming for a number of years now, and have had the opportunity to experience both large and small projects in different settings. They have been personal, academic and commerical projects. I am fascinated by large complex systems and particularly enjoy working on tools for making these systems more manageable. 

I have experience with everything from web and game development to embedded systems (real-time and bare metal), RTL and analog integrated circuits. I have knowledge about operating systems, networking, build systems, containers, SCM, CI/CD, testing, datastructures and algorithms etc.

I have experience with, among others, C, Python, Swift, C++, Java, MATLAB, Rust, Javascript, VHDL, Verilog, Erlang, Haskell, SQL, Assembly (AVR, ARM, MIPS).

### Other

Holds a class B driving license.
